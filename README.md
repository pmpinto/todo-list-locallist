### What you should see
When you first open the project you should see a welcome screen with a "get started" button.
Pressing that button will make it disappear.

Then you will be presented with a few tasks. Feel free to follow along to get used to the interface.

You should now be able to click any of those task's text to edit it, or remove it by clicking the "remove" button that appears when you hover over a task.

By clicking on the big input field above you will be able to add new tasks to your list. You can either press the "add to list" button or press ENTER.

Completed tasks will be stored on a seperate list that should appear on the right side or below the tasks, depending on the size of your screen.

That's pretty much it. Enjoy it!
